# kandinsky-tools
Scripts for Kandinsky 2.2.
Code is largely derived from the [official examples](https://github.com/ai-forever/diffusers/blob/main/examples/kandinsky2_2_train/) and [Waifu Diffusion](https://github.com/harubaru/waifu-diffusion/).<br> If you somehow come across this, don't use it yet, things are in an incredibly sorry state.
